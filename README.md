# CS4076
Progress of a Zork-Inspired game written in C++

Goal - Construct a game of your own choice 
Language - C++
Framework - QT
Time - 3 months


Week 1 Update - Create changes to the skeleton Zork code so it compiles successfuly.
                Next Goal: Add a room to the already existing areas

Week 2 Update - Completed: Created a new room in the existing map and updated it using a pull request! The file that was updated was ZorkUL.cpp
                Goal: Add a new command word "teleport" which will move the user to a room orf choice (or random room). 
                (The decisiion will be specified in a future comment!)
                
Week 3 Update - Update: Still working on the teleport function!
                Completed: Begin a QT Widget project which will be the *true* beginning of the semester long project. 
                Goal: Place a text space and push button that once clicked will send a message to the user.
       
Week 4 Update - Goal: Rewrite the Room code so the rooms can be accessed through an array of pointers
                In-Progress: Currently working on picking game theme and game basics

Week 5 Update - Goal: Implement inline functions, c++ references, default parameters and function templates into the Zork code.
                In-Progress: Trying out GUI layout variations 
                
Week 6 Update - This week I focused on trying to understand all the requirements that I need to include in my Zork code. I put in the time to go through C++ and see where certain things will suit the game.
                Completed: Uploaded Game Document Version 1 and uploaded an updated map and rooms

Week 7 Update: Back to coding, will try and improve the necessary updates from week 4 and 5

Week 8 and 9 Update: Working on UI and improving functionality of code. Really need to focus on getting all the requirements into my code. but first get the base functionality of the code to work perfectly.
